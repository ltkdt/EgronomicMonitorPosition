# EgronomicMonitorPosition

This is my embedded project that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between your eyes and the monitor of a screen. 

If the distance is not ideal, then an annoying beep sound can be heard. If it is, music will be played. 

The idea behind this project is to fix posture for those who have unhealthy habits of keeping your eyes too close or far from the monitor, which leads to eye strain. 

Considering that I'm talking about computer screeen, this poor habit is more damaging than that of which books and documents replace the monitor.

Components:

- ESP32
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- HY-SRF05 Ultrasonic Sensor
- OLED screen to display distance
- A buzzer to create sound

Wiring.txt will tell you how to connect the pins.
